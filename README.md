# PD Coding Exercise
## Kristina Auckland

I have been tasked with creating either a modal or popover based on the following brief: https://gist.github.com/nlhkabu/641312e5a910c1fcc5a5c3f34e680afb

## Getting Started

Checkout the repository.

### Running the site

Navigate into the repository

```
$ cd /pd-coding-exercise
```

Run a server, for example: `SimpleHTTPServer`

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

After you hit enter, you should see the following message:

```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Open a browser and navigate to:

```
http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```
